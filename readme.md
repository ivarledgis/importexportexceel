There are 3 roles here .. 
    1. Student
    2. Teacher
    3. Admin

Student can just login and logout 
Teacher can login and see all the list of students
Admin can login as well as import/export exceel

i didn't use pivot table here . made as simple as i can . just added a role column in user table and worked around based on that column.

P.S pls run . "Php artinsan db:seed command"
